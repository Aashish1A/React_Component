# Hard Level Components (10 Components)

Advanced level components requiring system design thinking, complex algorithms, and sophisticated state management. These are typically asked in senior-level interviews.

## 🎯 Priority Order

### 01. Complex Data Management (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ⭐⭐⭐

_Enterprise-level data handling - Most valuable for senior roles_

1. **Data Table** - Advanced table with sorting, filtering, pagination
2. **Tree Navigation** - Hierarchical data structure with expand/collapse
3. **Product Store** - E-commerce with cart, filters, search, categories
4. **Event Management** - Calendar with CRUD, scheduling, conflicts

### 02. Advanced UI Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY) ⭐⭐

_Complex UI interactions requiring deep React knowledge_

5. **Files Explorer** - File system interface with drag/drop, context menu
6. **OTP Input Component** - Advanced input handling with auto-focus/validation
7. **Nested Checkbox** - Hierarchical selection with parent-child relationships
8. **Pagination** - Advanced pagination with dynamic page sizing

### 03. System Design Level (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY) ⭐⭐

_Application-level thinking_

9. **Sticky Notes Component** - Multi-note management with positioning, persistence
10. **Match Pair Game** - Memory game with advanced scoring, levels, animations

## 📚 Implementation Guidelines

### Time Allocation

- **Complex Data Management**: 90-120 minutes each
- **Advanced UI Patterns**: 60-90 minutes each
- **System Design**: 60-120 minutes each

### Key Learning Points

- ✅ **System Architecture** - Component composition and data flow
- ✅ **Performance Optimization** - Virtual scrolling, memoization, lazy loading
- ✅ **Complex State Management** - useReducer, Context API, or external state management
- ✅ **Advanced Algorithms** - Tree traversal, searching, sorting
- ✅ **Data Persistence** - LocalStorage, IndexedDB integration
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error boundaries and validation
- ✅ **Accessibility** - ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- ✅ **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, and E2E test considerations

## 🚀 Recommended Learning Path

### Phase 1: Master Data Handling

1. **Data Table** - Start with basic table, add features incrementally
2. **Tree Navigation** - Learn recursive rendering and tree algorithms

### Phase 2: Complex UI Interactions

3. **Files Explorer** - Combines drag/drop with tree structure
4. **Nested Checkbox** - Advanced form logic with parent-child relationships

### Phase 3: Full Applications

5. **Product Store** - Complete e-commerce functionality
6. **Event Management** - Calendar with complex date/time logic

## 💡 Interview Tips for Hard Level

### Technical Focus Areas

1. **Architecture Discussion** - Explain component structure and data flow
2. **Performance Considerations** - Discuss optimization strategies
3. **Scalability** - How would this work with 10,000+ items?
4. **Error Handling** - What could go wrong and how to handle it?
5. **Testing Strategy** - How would you test this component?

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with MVP** - Get basic functionality working first
2. **Incremental Features** - Add complexity step by step
3. **Performance Later** - Optimize after core functionality is complete
4. **Document Decisions** - Explain trade-offs and design choices

### Common Patterns

- **Compound Components** - For complex UI with multiple parts
- **Render Props** - For flexible, reusable logic
- **Custom Hooks** - Extract complex logic
- **Context + Reducer** - For complex state management
- **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### For Data Table

- Handles 1000+ rows smoothly
- Sorting works on all columns
- Filtering is responsive
- Pagination is intuitive

### For Tree Navigation

- Handles nested data 5+ levels deep
- Expand/collapse is smooth
- Search works across all levels
- Keyboard navigation works

### For Product Store

- Multiple filters work together
- Cart persists across page refreshes
- Search is debounced and fast
- Responsive on all devices

These components demonstrate senior-level React skills and system design thinking!
